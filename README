Puppet tinydns module.

**Usage**

1. To set up a dnscache:

node "ns1.domain.com" inherits basenode {
	include ...,
		tinydns

	$dnscache = "/etc/dnscache"
	$dnscache_root = "$dnscache/root"

	# set up the cache itself
	tinydns::cache { "dnscache":
		directory => $dnscache,
		listen_address "1.2.3.4",
		ensure => present
	}

	# do we want to forward for any zones?
	$fwd_zones = [
		"$dnscache_root/servers/domain1.com",
		"$dnscache_root/servers/domain2.com"
	]

	# set up the forwarding and tell dnscache where to forward to
	tinydns::forwardzone { $fwd_zones:
		service => "dnscache", # must match the dnscache title above
		data => "1.2.3.4\n"
	}

	# allow some people to query the cache
	$allow_files = [
		"$dnscache_root/ip/127.0.0.1",
		$dnscache_root/ip/10"
	]

	# set up the allow files
	tinydns::cacheallow { $allow_files:
		service => "dnscache" # must match the dnscache title above
	}
}

2. To set up a Tinydns master:

node "ns1.domain.com" inherits basenode {
	include ...,
		tinydns,
		tinydns::server::base

	$tinydns = "/etc/tinydns"

	# we have some slave servers
	$slaves = [
		"ns2.domain.com"
	]

	# we're authoritative for these zones
	$zones = [
		"domain.com"
	]

	# set up the server
	tinydns::server { "tinydns":
		directory => $tinydns,
		listen_address => "1.2.3.4",
		ensure => present
	}

	# we're master
	tinydns::master { "tinydns":
		directory => $tinydns,
		slaves => $slaves,
		zones => $zones,
		ensure => present
	}
}

3. To set up a Tinydns slave:

node "ns2.domain.com" inherits basenode {
	include ...,
		tinydns,
		tinydns::server::base

	$tinydns = "/etc/tinydns"

	# set up the server
	tinydns::server { "tinydns":
		directory => $tinydns,
		listen_address => "1.2.3.4",
		ensure => present
	}

	# we're slave
	tinydns::slave { "tinydns":
		directory => $tinydns,
		ensure => present
	}
}

**Miscellaneous notes**

This module depends on the following file:
- tinydns/files/etc/dnsroots.global 

To create this file, run the following script:
- tinydns/files/scripts/updateroots.sh

You may want to run it from cron once a month or so. It updates the list of root servers from Internic's list.

It's up to you to ensure appropriate ssh keys are set up on the master and slaves to ensure propagation when you run `make'.

You must create and manage the actual zone files.
